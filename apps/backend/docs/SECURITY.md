# Security Guide

This document provides a security checklist and remediation steps for the application.

## Authentication and Authorization

- [x] **Secure Password Storage**: Passwords are hashed using `bcrypt` before being stored in the database.
- [x] **JWT-based Authentication**: Access to protected endpoints is controlled by JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are signed and have a limited expiration time.
- [x] **Token Blacklisting**: A token blacklist is implemented to immediately invalidate tokens upon logout, preventing their reuse.
- [x] **Refresh Token Rotation**: Refresh tokens are rotated with each use, and a mechanism is in place to detect and prevent token reuse.
- [x] **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: A tenancy guard is in place to ensure that users can only access resources belonging to their tenant.

## File Uploads

- [x] **File Type Validation**: Only a predefined list of allowed MIME types is accepted for file uploads.
- [x] **File Size Limits**: File uploads are restricted to a maximum size of 5MB to prevent resource exhaustion.
- [x] **Filename Sanitization**: Filenames are sanitized to remove special characters and prevent path traversal attacks.
- [x] **Secure Storage**: Files are stored in a secure, isolated environment, and access is restricted.

## API Security

- [x] **Rate Limiting**: Rate limiting and slow-down middleware are in place to protect against brute-force attacks and prevent abuse.
- [x] **Helmet**: Helmet is used to set various HTTP headers that help protect against common web vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and clickjacking.
- [x] **CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is enabled to control which domains can access the API.
- [x] **Input Validation**: All user input is validated to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.

## Remediation Steps

- **Regularly review and update dependencies**: Keep all libraries and frameworks up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
- **Perform regular security audits**: Conduct periodic security assessments to identify and address new threats.
- **Monitor logs for suspicious activity**: Continuously monitor application logs to detect and respond to security incidents.
- **Educate developers on security best practices**: Provide ongoing training to ensure the development team is aware of common security risks and how to mitigate them.
