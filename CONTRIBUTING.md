# Contributing

We use a CI pipeline to automate checks on our code. When you open a pull request, the following checks will be run:

- **Linting and Testing**: Your code will be linted and tested to ensure it meets our quality standards.
- **Building**: The backend and frontend applications will be built to ensure they are working correctly.
- **Docker Builds**: Docker images for the backend and frontend applications will be built to ensure they can be containerized.

All of these checks must pass before your pull request can be merged.
