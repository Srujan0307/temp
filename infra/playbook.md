# Ansible Playbook: Backup and Restore

This playbook outlines the steps required to back up and restore the database and MinIO storage.

## Backup Verification

To verify the backup, follow these steps:

1.  **Check the backup files:**

    - Ensure that the backup files exist in the designated backup location.
    - Verify that the file sizes are as expected and that there are no empty files.

2.  **Verify PostgreSQL backup:**

    - Restore the backup to a staging or development environment.
    - Check the data integrity by running queries against the restored database.

3.  **Verify MinIO backup:**

    - Restore the backup to a staging or development environment.
    - Verify that the files and objects are restored correctly and accessible.

## Compliance

Our backup and recovery strategy is designed to be compliant with SEBI/RBI regulations. The following measures have been implemented:

- **Backup Frequency:** Regular backups are scheduled to ensure that data is backed up at least once a day.
- **Retention Policies:** Backups are retained for a minimum of 90 days, with the option to extend the retention period based on business needs.
- **Data Encryption:** All backups are encrypted to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.

## Database Backup and Restore

### PostgreSQL Backup

To back up the PostgreSQL database, use the following command:

```bash
pg_dump -U <user> -h <host> -p <port> <database> > backup.sql
```

### PostgreSQL Restore

To restore the PostgreSQL database, use the following command:

```bash
psql -U <user> -h <host> -p <port> <database> < backup.sql
```

## MinIO Backup and Restore

### MinIO Backup

To back up MinIO, use the following command:

```bash
mc mirror <source> <destination>
```

### MinIO Restore

To restore MinIO, use the following command:

```bash
mc mirror <destination> <source>
```

### MinIO Point-in-Time Recovery

To perform a point-in-time recovery for MinIO, use the following command:

```bash
mc mirror --older-than 1d <source> <destination>
```

Replace `<source>` with the MinIO source and `<destination>` with the backup destination.
