# Horizontal Scaling Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for horizontally scaling the application to handle increased load.

## Backend

The backend is a stateless NestJS application. This makes it easy to scale horizontally by running multiple instances of the application behind a load balancer.

### Recommendations

*   **Run multiple instances:** Use a process manager like PM2 or a container orchestrator like Kubernetes to run multiple instances of the backend application.
*   **Load Balancer:** Use a load balancer (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy, or a cloud provider's load balancer) to distribute traffic evenly across the backend instances.
*   **Database Connections:** Ensure that the database connection pool is configured to handle the increased number of connections from the scaled-out backend instances.
*   **Redis:** Redis is used for caching and can be scaled independently. For high availability, consider using a Redis cluster.

## Frontend

The frontend is a static React application built with Vite. It can be scaled by serving the static files from a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

### Recommendations

*   **CDN:** Use a CDN (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront, or Vercel) to distribute the frontend assets globally. This will reduce latency for users by serving content from a location closer to them.
*   **Cache Invalidation:** Configure the CDN to cache the frontend assets and set up a cache invalidation strategy to ensure that users receive the latest version of the application when a new version is deployed.

## Resource Sizing

The number of instances and the resources allocated to each instance will depend on the expected load. It is recommended to perform load testing to determine the optimal resource allocation. Start with a baseline configuration and monitor the application's performance under load, then adjust the resources as needed.
